# MatchedValueLogBC

!syntax description /BCs/MatchedValueLogBC

## Overview

`MatchedValueLogBC` is based on Henryâ€™s Law, such that `MatchedValueLogBC` matches a variable to the value of a coupled variable based on the ratio of liquid phase density to gas phase density, in the form of:

\begin{equation}
H  u = v
\end{equation}

Where $u$ is our variable of interest, $v$ is the coupled variable we are trying to match, and $H$ is the ratio between variables.

!alert warning title=Untested Class
The MatchedValueLogBC does not have a formalized test, yet. For this reason,
users should be aware of unforeseen bugs when using MatchedValueLogBC. To
report a bug or discuss future contributions to Zapdos, please refer to the
