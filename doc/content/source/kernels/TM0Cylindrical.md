# TM0Cylindrical

!syntax description /Kernels/TM0Cylindrical

## Overview

`TM0Cylindrical` is the wave equation for the magnetizing field. `TM0Cylindrical` assumes an axisymmetric transverse magnetic (TM) wave and negligible current density compared to the displacement current.

The wave equation for the H-field is defined as

\begin{equation}
  \nabla \times \nabla \times \textbf{H} = \text{-} \varepsilon \mu_{0} \omega^{2} \textbf{H}
\end{equation}

Where $\textbf{H}$ is the magnetizing field, $\varepsilon$ is the material permittivity, $\mu_{0}$ is the permeability of free space, and $\omega$ is the frequency. By assuming an axisymmetric cylindrical geometry, the wave equation simplifies to

\begin{equation}
  \nabla^2 \text{H}_{\theta} - \frac{\text{H}_{\theta}}{r^2} = \text{-} \varepsilon \mu_{0} \omega^{2} \text{H}_{\theta}
\end{equation}

Where $H_{\phi}$ is the azimuthal component of the magnetizing field and $r$ is the radial distance from the axial centerline.
