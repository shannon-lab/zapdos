Zapdos utilizes the fluid description of plasmas to model a wide range of applications, for both industrial and fusion purposes.
A summary of the models that Zapdos employees can be found on the [Plasma Models page](plasma_modeling.md). Zapdos is based on the
[MOOSE framework](https://mooseframework.inl.gov), and builds on the framework and modules for many of its capabilities.
