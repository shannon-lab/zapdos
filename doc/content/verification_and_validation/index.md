# Verification & Validation (V&V)

Add a description of how cool V&V is.

Below at verification, benchmarking, and validation. The suggested nomenclature is as follows:

Abbreviations:

- ver: verification
- ben: benchmarking (code-to-code comparison)
- val: validation

First Number Set:

- 1: Industrial Plasmas (e.g. low-temperature plasmas for microchip manufacturing, biomedical, agriculture, etc.)
- 2: Magnetic Fusion Plasmas (strictly magnetically confident fusion plasmas)
- 3: Space Plasmas (e.g. astrophysics and ion propulsion)

Second Number Set:

- The listing order of the cases

Third Number Set:

- The listing order of the sub-cases
