As a user of Zapdos you have access to some support from developers and other users via the community disucssions forum:

[https://github.com/shannon-lab/zapdos/discussions](https://github.com/shannon-lab/zapdos/discussions)


If you are struggling with an issue search to see if someone else has run into the same problem and if they haven't start a new discussion. You're also welcome to start a discussion about how to contribute any functionality you have developed so others can use it. Finally, if you encounter a replicatable bug in Zapdos code or would like to request a new feature be developed you can visit our issues page:

[https://github.com/shannon-lab/zapdos/issues](https://github.com/shannon-lab/zapdos/issues)

We do not have time to develop all requested features but we are happy to help others get started in developing and contributing the features they need for their work :)
