Since each application is stateless and command-line driven, developing a thorough test suite is generally more straightforward than it is for other business system type software. The MOOSE repository includes a general-purpose, extendable &quot;Test Harness&quot;, which is heavily leveraged to run the test cases. The Test Harness is used throughout all phases of MOOSE development from initial development, the change request process, deployment testing, and finally end-use in-situ testing. The Test Harness is even suitable for testing on large deployment clusters and supports the &quot;PBS&quot; queuing system.</p><p>The Test Harness includes a suite of &quot;Tester&quot; types to enable complete testing of <span class="tooltipped" data-tooltip="Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment" data-position="top" data-delay="50">MOOSE</span> and MOOSE-based applications .For each of the types.
