# This example sets up a simple varying-voltage discharge with a
# dielectric at the right boundary.
#
# Two charged particle species are considered, creatively named 'pos'
# and 'neg'. They both have the same initial conditions and boundary
# conditions; the only difference is their charge.
# As the voltage varies, the particle flux to the right boundary
# (including both advection and diffusion) will switch polarity and
# the surface charge will become increasingly negative or positive.
#
# The left boundary is a driven electrode with a sinusoidal waveform.
# A dielectric boundary condition including surface charge accumulation
# is included on the right boundary.
#
# Note that without surface charge the electric field across both
# boundaries should be identical since their permittivities are
# both set to the same value.
# Surface charge shields the electric field in the gas region,
# preventing strong field buildup.
